## MOTIVATION

TTT Reborn is aimed to be the spiritual successor of [TTT](https://ttt.badking.net/) but developed for [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news). Our first goal is to perfect the vanilla TTT experience. Then, similarly as we did for [TTT2](https://github.com/TTT-2/TTT2), create a framework that will allow users to extend the gamemode (i.e roles, weapons, etc).

## DEVELOPMENT

We are still in the early development process due to our team having limited access to s&box. We plan to provide more information as development occurs, meanwhile, feel free to participate and chat about the project in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Npcbb4W).

You can also find additional information from our [TTT Reborn Facepunch forum post](https://forum.facepunch.com/t/ttt-reborn-for-s-box/243652).
