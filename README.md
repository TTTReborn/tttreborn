## MOTIVATION

TTT Reborn is aimed to be the spiritual successor of [TTT](https://ttt.badking.net/) but developed for [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news). Our first goal is to perfect the vanilla TTT experience. Then, similarly as we did for [TTT2](https://github.com/TTT-2/TTT2), create a framework that will allow users to extend the gamemode (i.e roles, weapons, etc).

We would also like to thank Bad King Urgrain for creating the original TTT and granting us permission to create TTT for s&box.
